\begin{Problem}
Start with the data $(K, L, \psi)$ of two groups $K$ and $L$ and a
group homomorphism $\psi : K \to \mathrm{Aut}(L)$. Show that the
Cartesian product $L \times K$ becomes a group with operation
$$
(l, k) \cdot (l^\prime, k^\prime) = (l\psi(k)(l^\prime), k k^\prime).
$$
\end{Problem}

\begin{Answer}
The product so defined yields a group:
\begin{itemize}
  \item[(Associativity)]
    {Let $l_1, l_2, l_3 \in L$ and $k_1, k_2, k_3 \in K$. Then
     \begin{align*}
       (l_1, k_1) \cdot ((l_2, k_2) \cdot (l_3, k_3))
    &= (l_1, k_1) \cdot
       (l_2 \psi(k_2) (l_3), k_2 k_3) \\
    &= (l_1 \psi(k_1)(l_2 \psi(k_2) (l_3)), k_1 k_2 k_3)
    \end{align*}
    while
    \begin{align*}
      ((l_1, k_1) \cdot (l_2, k_2)) \cdot (l_3, k_3) 
   &= (l_1 \psi(k_1)(l_2), k_1 k_2) \cdot (l_3, k_3) \\
   &= (l_1 \psi(k_1)(l_2)
       \psi(k_1 k_2) (l_3), k_1 k_2 k_3).
    \end{align*}
    so the operation is associative in the second component.
    Furthermore since $\psi(k)$ is a homomorphism for all $k \in K$,
    \begin{align*}
     l_1 \psi(k_1)(l_2 \psi(k_2)(l_3))
  &= l_1 \psi(k_1)(l_2) \psi(k_1)(\psi(k_2)(l_3)) \\
  &= (l_1 \psi(k_1)(l_2))
      (\psi(k_1) \circ \psi(k_2))(l_3)\\
  &= (l_1 \psi(k_1)(l_2))
      \psi(k_1 k_2)(l_3)
     \end{align*}
     and so the first component agrees as well. Therefore the
     operation is associative.
    }
  \item[(Closure)]
    {
      Since $k \in K$, $\psi(k) \in \mathrm{Aut}(L)$, so
      since $l^\prime \in L$ this means $\psi(k)(l^\prime) \in
      L$. Therefore $l \psi(k) l^\prime \in L$ since $L$ is a group
      and furthermore $k k^\prime \in K$, so 
      $(l\psi(k)(l^\prime), k k^\prime) \in L \times K$ and thus the
      set is closed under this operation.
    }
  \item[(Unit)]
    {
      Let $1_L$ and $1_K$ be the identity elements of groups $L$ and
      $K$, respectively, and let $l \in L$, $k \in K$. Then
      $$
      (l, k) \cdot (1_L, 1_K)
    = (l \psi(k)(1_L), k 1_K)
    = (l 1_L, k 1_K)
    = (l, k),
      $$
      since $\psi(k)$ is a homomorphism $L \to L$ which requires
      $\psi(1_L) = 1_L$. Furthermore
      $$
      (1_L, 1_K) \cdot (l, k)
    = (1_L \psi(1_K)(l), 1_K k)
    = (1_L \mathrm{id}(l), 1_K k)
    = (1_L l, 1_K k)
    = (l, k)
      $$
      since $\psi$ is a homomorphism $K \to \mathrm{Aut}(L)$ which 
      requires $\psi(1_K) = 1_{\mathrm{Aut}(L)} = \mathrm{id}$.

      Therefore $(1_L, 1_K)$ is an identity for the product so defined.
    }
    \item[(Inverses)]
      {Consider that
       \begin{align*}
         (l, k) \cdot (\psi(k^{-1})(l^{-1}), k^{-1})
      &= (l \psi(k)(\psi(k^{-1})(l^{-1}), k k^{-1}) \\
      &= (l \psi(k)(\psi(k)^{-1}(l^{-1})), k k^{-1}) \\
      &= (l (\psi(k) \circ \psi(k)^{-1})(l^{-1}), k k^{-1}) \\
      &= (l l^{-1}, k k^{-1}) \\
      &= (1_L, 1_K),
       \end{align*}
       and similarly
       \begin{align*}
          (\psi(k^{-1})(l^{-1}), k^{-1}) \cdot (l, k)
       &= (\psi(k^{-1})(l^{-1}) \psi(k^{-1})(l), k^{-1} k) \\
       &= (\psi(k^{-1})(l^{-1} l), k^{-1} k) \\
       &= (\psi(k^{-1})(1_L), 1_K) \\
       &= (1_L, 1_K)
       \end{align*}
       so the operation has inverses of this form.
      }
\end{itemize}
Therefore $L \times K$ is a group with this operation.

\begin{Problem}
Let $G$ be a group, $H < G$, $N \triangleleft G$. Suppose that 
$H \cap N = \{ 1 \}$ and that $G = NH$.
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
  \item{Show that the map $N \times H \to G$ given by
        $(n, h) \mapsto nh$ is a bijection.}
  \item{Show that the map $H \to \mathrm{Aut}(N)$ given by
      $h \mapsto c_h$, where $c_h(n) = h n h^{-1}$ is conjugation by
      $h$, is a group homomorphism.}
  \item{Observe that 
        $$
        n_1 h_1 n_2 h_2 
      = n_1 h_1 n_2 h_1^{-1} h_1 h_2
      = n_1 c_{h_1}(n_2) h_1 h_2
        $$
        and show that there is a group isomorphism between $G$ and the
        semidirect product $N \rtimes_c H$ (as in problem 1).}
\end{enumerate}
\end{Problem}

\begin{Answer}
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
  \item{Since $G = NH = \{ nh \mid n \in N, h \in H \}$, 
        the map $\varphi((n, h)) = nh$ is surjective.

        Next let $(n, h) \in \ker \varphi \subset N \times H$. Then 
        $nh = 1$, so $n = h^{-1}$ and $h = n^{-1}$. But if
        $n = h^{-1}$, then since $H$ is a subgroup $n \in H$
        and thus $n \in N \cap H = \{1\}$. 
        Similarly if $h = n^{-1}$, then
        since $N$ is a subgroup $h \in N$ so $h \in N \cap H = \{1\}$.
        Therefore $(n, h) = (1, 1)$, so $\ker \varphi$ is trivial.
        Therefore $\varphi$ is injective.

        Then $\varphi$ is bijective.
       }
  \item{
    Letting $\chi : H \to \mathrm{Aut}(N)$ be given by
    $\chi(h) = c_h$, we have
    \begin{align*}
     \chi(h h^\prime) =  c_{h h^\prime}(n)
  &= (h h^\prime) n (h h^\prime)^{-1} \\
  &= h h^\prime n (h^\prime)^{-1} h^{-1} \\
  &= h c_{h^\prime}(n) h^{-1}
  &= c_h (c_{h^\prime} (n)) \\
  &= (c_h \circ c_{h^\prime})(n) = \chi(h) \chi(h^\prime),
    \end{align*}
    so this is a group homomorphism.
  }
  \item{
    Take $\varphi$ as defined in part (a). We first show that
    $\varphi$ is a homomorphism:
    $$
    \varphi((n_1, h_1) \cdot (n_2, h_2))
  = \varphi((n_1 n_2, h_1 h_2))
  = n_1 n_2 h_1 h_2
    $$
    
    Since $\varphi$ is
    bijective it has an inverse $\varphi^{-1} : NH \to N \times H$, so
    \begin{align*}
    \varphi^{-1}(n_1 h_1 n_2 h_2)
 &= \varphi^{-1}(n_1 c_{h_1}(n_2) h_1 h_2) \\
 &= (n_1 c_{h_1}(n_2), h_1 h_2) \\
 &= (n_1 c(h_1)(n_2), h_1 h_2) \\
 &= (n_1, h_1) \cdot (n_2, h_2) \\
 &= \varphi^{-1}(n_1 h_1) \varphi^{-1}(n_2 h_2)
    \end{align*}
    where the product 
    $\cdot$ is taken from the group $N \rtimes_c H$. Since $G = NH$,
    every $g \in G$ has the form $g = nh$ for some $n \in N$ and $h
    \in H$, so this identity means 
    $\varphi^{-1} : G \to N \rtimes_{\psi} H$ is a group
    homomorphism, and since it is invertible this means
    $G \simeq N \rtimes_{\psi} H$.
  }

\begin{Problem}
Suppose that $H$ and $N$ are normal subgroups of a finite group $G$.
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
  \item{Show that $HN = \{ hn \mid h \in H, n \in H \}$ 
        is a subgroup of $G$.}
  \item{Now suppose in addition that the orders of $H$ and $N$ are
      relatively prime, i.e. that $\mathrm{gcd}(|H|,|N|) = 1$. Show
      that $hn = nh$ for all $h \in H$, $n \in N$, and that $HN$ is
      isomorphic to the direct product $H \times N$.}
\end{enumerate}
\end{Problem}

\begin{Answer}
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
  \item{We show that $HN$ contains the unit and is closed under the
      group operations.
  \begin{itemize}
    \item[(Unit)]
    {
      Since $H$ and $N$ are subgroups, $1 \in H$ and $1 \in N$, so
      $1 = 1 \cdot 1 \in HN$.
    }
    \item[(Product)]
    {
      Let $x_1, x_2 \in HN$. Then $x_1 = h_1 n_1$ and $x_2 = h_2 n_2$
      for some $h_1, h_2 \in H$, $n_1, n_2 \in N$. Therefore
      \begin{align*}
        x_1 \cdot x_2 &= h_1 n_1 h_2 n_2 = h_1 h_2 n_1^\prime n_2
      \end{align*}
      since $N \triangleleft G$ and thus $n_1 h_2 = h_2 n_1^\prime$
      for some $n_1^\prime \in N$. But this means $x_1 \cdot x_2 \in HN$ so
      $HN$ is closed under the group product inherited from $G$.
    }
    \item[(Inverses)]
    {
      Let $x \in HN$. Then $x = hn$ for some $h \in H$, $n \in N$.
      Then $x^{-1} = (nh)^{-1} = h^{-1} n^{-1}$. But since $n$ is
      normal in $G$ and since $h^{-1} \in G$, $h^{-1} n^{-1} =
      n^\prime h^{-1}$ for some $n^\prime \in N$, and thus
      $x = n^\prime h^{-1} \in NH$. Therefore the inverse of each
      element in $NH$ is also in $NH$.      
    }
  \end{itemize}
  Therefore $NH < G$.
  }
  \item
  {
    Consider the group action of $N$ on $H$ given by
    $$
    . : N \times H \to H, \quad 
    n . h = n h n^{-1}.
    $$
    Then since $H$ is the disjoint union of the orbits $N . h$ of this
    action, the order of $H$ is
    \begin{align*}
    |H| &= \sum_h [N : N . h] = \sum_h \frac{|N|}{|N . h|} \\
        &= |N| \sum_h \frac{1}{|N . h|}
    \end{align*}
    where the sum is taken over representative elements $h \in H$.
    But $|H|$ and $|N|$ are coprime by assumption, so since $|H|$ divides
    $|N| \sum_h \frac{1}{|N . h|}$ this means $|H|$ divides
    $\sum_h \frac{1}{|N . h|}$ Therefore it must be the case that
    $\sum_h \frac{1}{|N . h|} \geq |H|$, which is only possible if
    $|N . h| = 1$ for all $h \in H$. But since $N / N_h \simeq N . h$
    this means $\frac{|N|}{|N_h|} = 1$ for every $h$ and therefore
    that $N_h = N$, or 
    $$
    \{ n \in N \mid n h n^{-1} = h \} = N
    $$
    for each $h \in H$, so $n h n^{-1} = h$ for all $n \in N, h \in H$
    as desired.

    Furthermore consider the function 
    $\psi : H \times N \to HN$ given by $\psi((h, n)) = h n$. Then we
    have
    \begin{align*}
       \psi((h_1, n_1) \cdot (h_2, n_2)) 
    &= \psi((h_1 h_2, n_1 n_2)) \\
    &= h_1 h_2 n_1 n_2.
    \end{align*}
    But we have just shown that $h_2 n_1 = n_1 h_2$, so this means
    \begin{align*}
       \psi((h_1, n_1) \cdot (h_2, n_2))
    &= h_1 n_1 h_2 n_2 \\
    &= \psi((h_1, n_1)) \psi((h_2, n_2))
    \end{align*}
    and thus that $\psi$ is a homomorphism. Furthermore this function
    is bijective as shown in Problem 2(a), so we have an isomorphism
    $H \times N \to HN$.

\begin{Problem}
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
  \item{Suppose that $Z(G)$ is the center of the group $G$. Prove that if
      the quotient $G / Z(G)$ is cyclic, then $G$ is abelian.}
  \item{Prove that every group of order $p^2$, where $p$ is prime, is
      abelian.}
  \item{For each prime $p$, give an example of a group of order $p^3$
      which is not abelian.}
\end{enumerate}
\end{Problem}

\begin{Answer}
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
  \item{
    First we observe that the conjugation map 
    $c : G \to \mathrm{Inn}(G)$ given by 
    $$
    c(h)(g) = c_h(g) = h g h^{-1}
    $$
    is a group homomorphism.
    Furthermore, let $x \in \ker c$ so that
    $c(x) = \mathrm{id}$.
    Then we have
    $$
    x y x^{-1} = c(x)(y) = \mathrm{id}(y) = y
    $$
    and thus $x y = y x$ for all $y \in G$, or in other words $x \in
    Z(G)$. Additionally if $x \in Z(G)$ then $xyx^{-1} = y$ for any 
    $y \in G$, so $c(x)(y) = y$ and thus $c(x) = \mathrm{id}$, so
    $x \in \ker c$. This means $\ker c = Z(G)$.

    By the first isomorphism theorem this means
    $$
    \mathrm{Inn}(G) 
  = \mathrm{Im}(c) 
  \simeq \frac{G}{\ker c}
  = \frac{G}{Z(G)}
  \simeq \mathbb{Z}_N
    $$
    for some positive integer $N$, since $G / Z(G)$ is cyclic by
    assumption. This means $\mathrm{Inn}(G) \simeq \mathbb{Z}_N$ or
    $\mathrm{Inn}(G)$ is cyclic and therefore 
    $\mathrm{Inn}(G) = \langle c_a \rangle$ for some $a \in G$.

    Next let $C_x$ denote the conjugacy class of $x$ in $G$.
    We wish to show that the only conjugacy class in $G$
    is $C_a$. We proceed by induction to show that 
    $c_a^n(g) = c_a(g)$ for all $n$.
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item{
        Let $n = 1$. Then $c_a^n(g) = c_a(g)$.
      }
      \item{
        Let $c_a^m(g) = c_a(g)$ for all 
        $m \in \{ 1, 2, \dots, n-1 \}$. Then
        $$
        c_a^n(g) = c_a(c_a^{n-1}(g)) = c_a(c_a(g)) = c_a^2(g) = c_a(g).
        $$
      }        
    \end{enumerate}
    Therefore $c_a^n(g) = c_a(g)$ for any $n$. Now since
    $\mathrm{Inn}(G)$ is cyclic, for any $x \in G$ we have 
    $c_x = c_a^n$ for some $n$. Therefore if $g \in C_x$ then
    $$
    g = c_x(g) = c_a^n(g) = c_a(g) \in C_a
    $$
    and if $g \in C_a$ then
    $$
    g = c_a(g) = c_a^n(g) = c_x(g) \in C_x
    $$
    so $C_x = C_a$ for any $x \in G$.

    Since $G$ is the disjoint union of the orbits of the group action
    $c$, his implies that $G = C_a = C_x$ for any $x \in G$ and thus
    each $x \in G$ commutes with the whole of $G$, so $G$ is abelian.
  }
  \item{
    Let $G$ be a group of order $p^2$. Then since $[G : C_x]$ divides
    $|G|$ for each $x \in G$, $[G : C_x]$ divides $p^2$ and so
    $[G : C_x] \in \{ 1, p, p^2 \}$ for each $x$. Since 
    $1 \in Z(G)$, $|Z(G)| \neq 0$ and so $[G : C_x] \neq p^2$
    for any $x$. Then the class equation can be written in this case
    to give
    $$
    p^2 = n p + |Z(G)| 
    $$
    or
    $$
    p(p - n) = |Z(G)|
    $$
    and therefore $p$ divides $|Z(G)|$. Therefore either $|Z(G)| =
    p^2$, 
    in which case $G = Z(G)$ and $G$ is abelian, or $|Z(G)| =
    p$. 
    But in the latter case
    $$
    |\frac{G}{Z(G)}| = \frac{|G|}{|Z(G)|} = p
    $$
    for $p$ prime, and since $\frac{G}{Z(G)}$ is of prime order it
    must be cyclic. The result from part (a) then implies that $G$
    is abelian.
  }
  \item{
    Let $p$ be prime and let $G$ be the subgroup of 
    $GL_3(\mathbb{Z}_p)$ given by matrices of the form
    $$
    \left[\begin{array}{c c c}

    We verify that this is a group since
    $$

    \left[\begin{array}{c c c}

\begin{Answer}
  \begin{enumerate}[(a)]
    \item{
      Consider the group actions
      $\psi_G : G \to \mathrm{Perm}(G)$ and
      $\psi_H : H \to \mathrm{Perm}(G)$ given by conjugation
      so that
      $$
      \psi_G(g_1)(g_2) = g_1 g_2 g_1^{-1}, \quad
      \psi_H(h)(g) = h g h^{-1}.
      $$
      Equivalently consider these as
      $._G : G \times G \to G$ and $._H : H \times G \to G$, respectively.
      We can then decompose both $G$ and $H$ into their orbits so that
      $$
      G = \coprod_{x \in R_G} G ._G x, \quad
      H = \coprod_{x \in R_H} H ._H x,
      $$
      where $R_G$ and $R_H$ are sets of representative elements from
      conjugacy classes of $G$ and $H$, respectively.
      We then see that
      \begin{align*}
        G &= \coprod_{x \in R_G} G ._G x \\
          &= \coprod_{x \in R_G} \{ h x h^{-1} \mid h \in H \} \\
          &= \coprod_{x \in R_G} \left(
               \{ h x h^{-1} \mid h \in H \}
               \cup
               \{ g x g^{-1} \mid g \in G - H \}
             \right) \\
          &= \left(\coprod_{x \in R_G} 
               \{ g x g^{-1} \mid g \in G - H \}
             \right)
             \cup
             \left(\coprod_{x \in R_G}
               \{ h x h^{-1} \mid h \in H \}
             \right) \\
          &= \left(\coprod_{x \in R_G} 
               \{ g x g^{-1} \mid g \in G - H \}
             \right)
             \cup
             \left(\coprod_{x \in R_G}
               H ._H x
             \right) \\
          &= \left(\coprod_{x \in R_G} 
               \{ g x g^{-1} \mid g \in G - H \}
             \right)
             \cup H,
      \end{align*}
      so that
      $$
      |G| - |H| = \sum_{x} \{ g x g^{-1} \mid g \in G - H \}.
      $$
      But by assumption $H$ is a proper subset of $G$, so
      $|G| - |H| > 0$ and therefore there are elements 
      of $G$ which do not lie in the
      orbit $H ._G x = \{ h x h^{-1} \mid h \in H \}$ for any
      $x \in G$. Therefore there is a $g \in G$
      not conjugate to any $h \in H$, as desired.
    }
    \item{
      We write
      $$
      G_y = \{ h \in G \mid h . y = y \}.
      $$
      Let $h \in G_y$. Then
      \begin{align*}
           & h . y = y \\
      \iff & h . (g . x) = g . x \\
      \iff & h g . x = g . x \\
      \iff & g^{-1} h g . x = x,
      \end{align*}
      so $h \in g^{-1} G_x g$. Therefore $G_y = g^{-1} G_x g$.
    }
    \item{
      If $G$ acts transitively on $X$, then there is only one orbit,
      so 
      $$
      X = \coprod_x G . x = G . x
      $$
      for some $x \in X$. But then
      $$
      |X| = |G . x| = [G : G_x] = \frac{|G|}{|G_x|}
      $$
      so that $|G_x| |X| = |G|$. But if $X$ contains more than one
      element then this means $|G_x| < |G|$, in which case
      $G - G_x$ is nonempty and therefore there is an element
      $g \in G$ that is not in the stabilizer $G_x$, i.e. that does
      not fix $x$ for any $x$ in the orbit $G . x$ and thus for any
      element $x \in X$.

\begin{Problem}
Let $G$ be a $p$-group where $p$ is a prime. Suppose that $x$ is an
element of order $p$ in $G$ such that the subgroup $\langle x \rangle$
generated by $x$ is normal in $G$. Show that $x$ belongs to the center
$Z(G)$ of $G$.
\end{Problem}

\begin{Answer}
Consider the group action $\psi : G \to \mathrm{Perm}(S)$ given by
$$
\psi(g)(x^i) = g x^i g^{-1},
$$
where $S$ is the set of powers $x^i$ of $x$. Note that the normality
of $\langle x \rangle$ ensures that the image of this map is inside of
$S$, since $\langle x \rangle \triangleleft G$ means that
$g x^i g^{-1} = x^j$ for any $g \in G$.

Decomposing the set $S$ into its orbits under this action we have
\begin{align*}
|S| &= \sum_{i=1}^p |G . x^i| = \sum_{i=1}^p [G : G_{x^i}] \\
    &= \sum_{i=1}^{p-1} [G : G_{x^i}] + [G : G_{x^p}] \\
    &= \sum_{i=1}^{p-1} [G : G_{x^i}] + [G : G_1] \\
    &= \sum_{i=1}^{p-1} [G : G_{x^i}] + 1,
\end{align*}
and since $|S| = p$ this is only possible if $[G : G_{x^i}] = 1$ for
each $i \in \{ 1, \dots, p \}$, which means $[G : G_x] = 1$ and
therefore $gx = xg$ for all $g \in G$. Therefore $x \in Z(G)$.


%Since $G$ is a $p$-group, let $|G| = p^m$ for some positive integer $m$.
%We wish to show that 
%$|G . x| = [G : G_x] = 1$ and therefore that $x \in Z(G)$.
%
%Since $x^p = 1$, $|\langle x \rangle|$ divides $p$,
%and since $p$ is prime this means either 
%$|\langle x \rangle| = 1$ or 
%$|\langle x \rangle| = p$.
%If 
%$|\langle x \rangle| = 1$ 
%then $\langle x \rangle = \{ 1 \}$, 
%so $x = 1$  and $1 \in Z(G)$, as desired.
%
%Otherwise, $|\langle x \rangle| = p$. Then since
%$\langle x \rangle$ is normal, it is equal
%to its normalizer so that
%$$
%  |\mathrm{Orb}(\langle x \rangle)|
%= [G : N(\langle x \rangle)] 
%= [G : \langle x \rangle]
%= |G| / |\langle x \rangle| 
%= p^m / p
%= p^{m-1},
%$$
%where $\mathrm{Orb}(H)$ is the set of all subgroups conjugate to $H$.

\begin{Problem}
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item{Let $G$ be a finite group and $H$ a subgroup of $G$. Let $Q$ be
    a $p$-Sylow subgroup of $H$. Show that there is a $p$-Sylow
    subgroup $P$ of $G$ such that $P \cap H = Q$.}
\item{Let $G$ be a finite group and $P$ a $p$-Sylow subgroup of
    $G$. Further let $N$ be a normal subgroup of $G$. Prove that $P
    \cap N$ is a $p$-Sylow subgroup of $N$.}
\end{enumerate}
\end{Problem}

\begin{Answer}
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
  \item{
    If $Q$ is a $p$-Sylow of $H$, then $Q$ is a $p$-subgroup of $G$,
    so it is contained in a $p$-Sylow of $G$ (Theorem 6.4(i) in Lang).
    Let $P$ be this $p$-Sylow of $G$. Then $P$ is a $p$-Sylow of $G$,
    and $Q \subset P$ and $Q \subset H$, so $Q \subset P \cap H$.

    Let $|P| = p^n$, $|Q| = p^m$ so that $|H| = p^m k$, 
    where $p$ does not divide $k$, 
    since $Q$ is a $p$-Sylow in $H$. Then $[H : Q] = k$, so we have
    $$
    [P : Q] = [P : H][H : Q] = [P : H]k.
    $$
    But $[P : H]$ divides $|P| = p^n$ and 
    $[P : Q] = \frac{p^n}{p^m} = p^{n - m}$, so this is only possible
    if $[P : H] = p^l$ for some power $l$. Then since
    $P \cap H \subset H$, 
    $[P : P \cap H] \geq [P : H]$, so $[P : P \cap H] = p^{n - m}$
    and thus $[P : P \cap H] = [P : Q]$. Then we have
    $$
    [P : P \cap H] = [P : Q] = [P : P \cap H] [P \cap H : Q],
    $$
    so $[P \cap H : Q] = 1$ and thus $|P \cap H| = |Q|$. But since
    $Q \subset P \cap H$ this means $Q = P \cap H$ as desired.
  }
  \item{
    Let $|P| = p^n$. $P \cap N$ is a subgroup since both $P$ and $N$
    are, and therefore the product (inverse) of elements of $P \cap N$ is
    contained in $P$ since the individuals are and is likewise
    contained in $N$ and thus is contained in $P \cap N$.

    Since $N$ is normal, the normalizer $N(N) = G$, so $P \subset
    N(N)$. Therefore the hypothesis of the third isomorphism theorem
    applies so that
    $$
    PN / N \simeq P / (P \cap N),
    $$
    so
    $$
    [PN : N] = [P : P \cap N]
    $$
    and thus
    $$
    |P \cap N| [PN : N] = |P|.
    $$
    Then $|P \cap N|$ divides $|P| = p^m$, so $|P \cap N| = p^m$ for
    some $m \leq n$. If $m = n$ then $P \cap N$ is a subgroup of order
    $p^n$, so $P \cap N$ is a $p$-Sylow of $G$ and therefore of
    $N$. Otherwise, $m < n$, and we wish to show that there is no
    subgroup of $N$ with order $p^{m^+}$ where $m^+ > m$. 

    Suppose $H$ is a $p$-group of $N$ with $|H| = p^{m+}$, for
    $m+ > m$. Such a power
    divides $|P|$ and does not divide $|P \cap N|$, so it must divide
    $[PN : N]$, which requires that $[PN : N] = p^{m^{++}}$ for some
    $m^{++} > m^+$. Then we have
    $$
    [PN : N] |N| = p^{m++} p^{m+} k
    $$
    for some $k$, since we must have $|H| = p^{m+}$ divide $|N|$.
    Then $|PN| = p^{m++}p^{m+} k$. But $PN \subset P \cap N$ and
    $|P \cap N| = p^m < p^{m++}p^{m+} k$, so this is a
    contradiction. Therefore it must be the case that there is no
    $p$-group with order larger than $p^m$ in $N$, so $P \cap N$ is a
    $p$-Sylow of $N$.
% But then $P \cap N$ is a
%    $p$-subgroup of $N$, and so it must be contained in a
%    $p$-Sylow of $N$.

%    Next let $S$ be the set of $p$-Sylows of $N$, and consider the
%    action $\psi : G \to \mathrm{Perm}(S)$ given by conjugation
%    $\psi(g)(H) = g H g^{-1}$. This is well-defined since all
%    $p$-Sylows are conjugate. Then we have the decomposition by this
%    action 
%    $$
%    |S| = \sum |G . x| = \sum [G : G_x]
%    $$
%    where each $[G : G_x]$ divides $|S|$ and $|S| \equiv 1 \mod p$.

%    We wish to show that $p^{m}$ is the largest power of $p$
%    that divides $|N|$. Suppose it is not, so that
%    $|N| = p^{m^+} k$ for some $k$ that $p$ does not divide and 
%    $m^+$ such that $m < m^+ \leq n$.
%    We can decompose $N$ into its orbits by
%    conjugation to see
%    \begin{align*}
%    |N| &= |Z(N)| + \sum [G : G_x]
%    \end{align*}
