\begin{Problem}
Show that if $P$ is a $p$-Sylow subgroup of a finite group $G$, then
$N_G(N_G(P)) = N_G(P)$, where $N_G(H)$ denotes the normalizer of $H$
in $G$.
\end{Problem}

\begin{Answer}
Let $|P| = p^k$ and $|G| = p^k m$, where $p \not\vert m$.
Note that $P$ is a subgroup of $N_G(P)$, so $|P| =
p^k$ divides $|N_G(P)|$. But $p^k$ is the maximal power of $p$ that
occurs in $|G|$, so it must be that $|N_G(P)| = p^k n$ for some $n$
such that $p \not\vert n$. Furthermore $N_G(P) < G$, so $n \vert m$.

 Show that $\#Orb_{N_G(N_G(P))}(N_G(P)) = [N_G(N_G(P)) : N_G(P)] = 1$

\begin{Problem}
Let $G$ be a finite group. Consider the sequence of subgroups of $G$
defined inductively by
$$
Z_0(G) = \{ 1 \}, \quad
Z_{i+1}(G) = \pi^{-1}(Z(G/Z_i(G)))
$$
where $\pi : G \to G / Z_i(G)$ is the natural quotient map. Then $G$
is called \emph{nilpotent} if $G_n = G$ for some $n \geq 0$.

\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
  \item{
    Show that for $i \geq 0$,
    $$
    Z_{i+1}(G) = \{ x \in G
                   \mid
                   xyx^{-1}y^{-1} \in Z_i(G), \forall y \in G
                \}.
    $$
  }
  \item{
    Show that if $G$ is nilpotent then $G$ is solvable.
  }
  \item{
    Show that a $p$-group, where $p$ is prime, is always nilpotent.
  }
  \item{
    Give an example of a group which is not nilpotent.
  }
  \item{
    Assume $G$ is nilpotent. Show that if $H$ is a proper subgroup of $G$, then
    the normalizer of $H$ in $G$ is always strictly larger than $H$.
  }
  \item{
    Suppose that $G$ is nilpotent and $P$ a $p$-Sylow subgroup of
    $G$. Show that $P$ is normal in $G$. (Hint: Use problem 1.)
  }
  \item{
    Show that $G$ is nilpotent if and only if it is isomorphic to the
    direct product of its $p$-Sylow subgroups. (Hint: recall that if
    $P$ and $Q$ are both normal in $G$ and $P \cap Q = \{ 1 \}$, then
    $ab = ba$ for all $a \in P$, $b \in Q$.

\begin{Problem}
Consider the group given by generators and relations as follows:
$$
G = \langle
      x, y, z
    \mid
      x^3 = y^7 = z^{13} = 1,
      x^{-1} y x = y^4,
      x^{-1} z x = z^{-1},
      yz = zy
    \rangle.
$$
What can you say about the order of $G$?
\end{Problem}

\begin{Answer}
First note that the condition $x^3 = y^7 = z^{13} = 1$ implies that
$G$ is no larger than the free product of cyclic groups
$\mathbb{Z}_3 \ast \mathbb{Z}_7 \ast \mathbb{Z}_{13}$. Furthermore
note that
