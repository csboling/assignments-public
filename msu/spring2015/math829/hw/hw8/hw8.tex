\begin{Problem}
Prove that any positive harmonic function in $\mathbb{R}^2$ is constant.
\end{Problem}

\begin{Answer}
Let $u : \mathbb{R}^2 \to \mathbb{R}$ be harmonic and strictly
positive. Then $u$ has a harmonic conjugate $v$, so that
$f = u + i v$ is holomorphic on $\mathbb{C}$. Then
$e^{-f} = e^{-u} e^{-iv}$ is entire as well, and $|e^{-f}| = e^{-u}$.
But since $-u < 0$, this means $|e^{-f}| \leq 1$ and so $e^{-f}$
is bounded and therefore constant. Thus
$\frac{d}{dz} e^{-f} = -f^\prime e^{-f} \equiv 0$  so $f^\prime \equiv
0$ and thus $f$ is constant. This means $f \equiv x + i y$ for some
fixed $x, y$, so $u = \mathrm{Re} f \equiv x$ and thus $u$ is constant.
\end{Answer}

\begin{Problem}
Let $u$ be a nonconstant harmonic function on $\mathbb{C}$. Show that
for any $c \in \mathbb{R}$, $u^{-1}(\{ c \})$ is unbounded.
Hint: The set $\{ |z| > R \}$ is connected for any $R$.
\end{Problem}

\begin{Answer}
Let $c \in \mathbb{R}$, and suppose by way of contradiction that
$u^{-1}(\{ c \})$ is unbounded. Then there is some $R > 0$ such that
$u^{-1}(\{ c \}) \subset D(0, R)$, so $u(z) \neq c$ for any
$z \in \{ z \in \mathbb{C} : |z| > R \}$. Define
$U = \{ z \in \mathbb{C} : |z| > R \}$.

Let $z_1, z_2 \in U$ and suppose $u(z_1) < c$, $u(z_2) > c$.
Since $U$ is connected, there is a path
$\gamma : [0, 1] \to U$ such that $\gamma(0) = z_1$ and
$\gamma(1) = z_2$. Then
$u \circ \gamma : [0, 1] \to \mathbb{R}$ is a continuous
real function on an interval
with $(u \circ \gamma)(0) < c$ and
$(u \circ \gamma)(1) > 1$, so from the intermediate value
theorem it must be that $u(\gamma(t_0)) = c$ for some
$t_0 \in [0, 1]$ and thus
$u(z_0) = c$ for $z_0 = \gamma(t_0) \in C$, a contradiction.
Therefore it suffices to assume $u(z) < c$
and observe that the argument is symmetric for $u(z) > c$.

Now since $u$ is continuous on $\bar{D}(0, R + \varepsilon)$
for any $\varepsilon > 0$, there is a
point $z_{\max} \in \partial D(0, R + \varepsilon)$ such that
$$
u(z_{\max}) = \max\{ u(z) : z \in D(0, R + \varepsilon) \} \geq c.
$$
But $\partial D(0, R + \varepsilon) \subset U$ so that
$z_{\max} \in U$ and $u(z) \leq z_{max}$
for all $z \in U$, so $u \equiv C$ on $U$ for a constant
$C \in \mathbb{C}$. Since $u$ is continuous on
$\bar{U} \subset \mathbb{C}$ it must be that $u \equiv C$ on
$\partial U$.
Finally, $\partial U = \partial D(0, R)$, so $u \equiv C$ on
$\partial D(0, R)$ and therefore $u$ is constant on $D(0, R)$.
We conclude that $u \equiv C$ on
$D(0, R) \cup \bar{U} = \mathbb{C}$, a contradiction.
Therefore $u^{-1}(\{ c \})$ is unbounded.
\end{Answer}

\begin{Problem}
Find the winding numbers of the curve $\gamma$ at the given points.
\end{Problem}

\begin{Answer}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item{
    $z_1$ lies in the unbounded component of
    $\mathbb{C} \backslash \gamma$, so $W(\gamma, z_1) = 0$.
  }
  \item{
    A line segment from $z_1$ to $z_2$ crosses the contour from its
    right to its left, so $W(\gamma, z_2) = 1 + W(\gamma, z_1) = 1$.
  }
  \item{
    A line segment from $z_1$ to $z_3$ crosses the contour from its
    left to its right, so $W(\gamma, z_3) = -1 + W(\gamma, z_1) = -1$.
  }
  \item{
    A line segment from $z_3$ to $z_4$ crosses the contour from its
    right to its left, so $W(\gamma, z_4) = 1 + W(\gamma, z_3) = 0$.
  }
  \item{
    A line segment from $z_4$ to $z_5$ crosses the contour from its
    left to its right, so $W(\gamma, z_5) = -1 + W(\gamma, z_4) = -1$.
  }
\end{enumerate}
\end{Answer}
